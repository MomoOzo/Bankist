# Bankist Project - JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann

Welcome to the Bankist Project! This is a banking application built with JavaScript, designed to practice and implement various JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, array methods, event handling, and more. The project is part of the _"The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!"_ by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## Features

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** (ES6+)
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **DOM Manipulation**

## How It Works

2. **Account Management**: Once logged in, users can:
   - View account balance and transaction history.
   - Perform money transfers to other users.
   - Request loans.
   - Delete accounts.
3. **Sorting Transactions**: Users can sort the transaction history either by amount or date.
